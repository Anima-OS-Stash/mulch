- File config
- API keys or challenge based auth
- "DataBase" ?
- mulchd should be able to run with a remote libvirtd (StoragePath disallow this, currently)
- support passphrase for Mulch SSH key
- check SSH key on startup? (warning?)

- create a specific HTTP muxer for /phone (only listening on mulch's virbr)

- check connection and access rights
- differentiate "rights issues" from  "libvirtd not running" issues
- check libvirt group / qemu user for storage?
