- API keys or challenge based auth
- mulchd should be able to run with a remote libvirtd (StoragePath disallow this, currently)
- support passphrase for Mulch SSH key
- move SSK Keys and MulchSuperUser to VM level

- change HTTP code from 200 to 4XXX in controllers when things fails (ex: req.Stream.Failure)
    - in client, make the non-200 error message silent in stream mode?

- see if it's possible for a VM to steal an IP from another VM (DoS)
- create a specific HTTP muxer for /phone (only listening on mulch's virbr)

- check connection and access rights
- differentiate "rights issues" from  "libvirtd not running" issues
- deal with libvirtd restart
- long run connection test to libvirt
- check libvirt group / qemu user for storage?
